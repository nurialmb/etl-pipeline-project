# ETL Data Pipeline Project

A simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built with **Python** and **SQLite**.  
This project demonstrates how to extract raw data, clean and transform it, and load it into a database for analysis.

## Features
- Data extraction from CSV files (or your source)
- Data cleaning and transformation with Python (pandas)
- Loading transformed data into SQLite database
- Workflow ready for orchestration with dbt / Airflow (future step)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite
- dbt (optional/future orchestration)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/nurialmb/etl-pipeline-project.git
2. Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the ETL script: python etl.py
   
## Sample Output
- Transformed data stored in `output.db`
- Cleaned data ready for analytics

## Next Steps
- Add orchestration with Airflow
- Automate workflow scheduling
